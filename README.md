# An Employee Database

This project was meant as an answer to the following exercise in *The Rust Programming Language* at the end of chapter of 8.

> Using a hash map and vectors, create a text interface to allow a user to add employee names to a department in a company. For example, “Add Sally to Engineering” or “Add Amir to Sales.” Then let the user retrieve a list of all people in a department or all people in the company by department, sorted alphabetically.

The result is this small program that can be easily built using cargo. Thanks to Rust all exceptions are handled, the program should be very hard to crash, and unexpected behaviours should be very hard to provoke as well.
